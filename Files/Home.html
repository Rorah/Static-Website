<h3>Brief History</h3>
<p class="center">In 1914, the first courses in Library Science were offered at the College of Liberal Arts of the University of the Philippines.This course was elevated to university level in 1916 when the four year curriculum was instituted to prepare students for professional work in libraries and for teaching Library Science courses.
<br>
<br>The Institute of Library Science was  founded in 1961 and later became the Institute of Library and Information Science on august 29, 2002, upon the approval of the Board of Regents.The change in name reflected the change in curriculum when the Institute shifted from the purely traditional forms of librarianship to information technology assisted librarianship.
<br>
<br>On March 29, 2007, the Board of Regents approved its second change of name to School of Library and Information Studies in recognition of its dynamic growth both in the number of enrollees and in the development of its curricular offerings.</p>
